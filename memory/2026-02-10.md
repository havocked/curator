# 2026-02-10 — Curator Session

## Done
- Built GetSongBPM provider + BPM cache (provider, cache table, orchestrator wiring, 25 tests)
- Couldn't get API key (their backlink verification is broken/aggressive)
- Nate decided to scrap it — removed all GetSongBPM code (~2,900 lines deleted)
- Deleted feature/audio-enrichment branch (fully merged to master)
- Removed stale docs: PHASE1_ENRICHMENT_SPEC.md, GENRE_TAG_OPTIONS_REPORT.md
- Rewrote ROADMAP.md to reflect current state
- Updated KNOWN_ISSUES.md with MusicBrainz mitigations
- **Full README rewrite:** fixed renamed commands (search→library), added cache docs, genre enrichment docs, Tidal credential setup, removed hardcoded paths, accurate test count
- Made repo public (havocked/curator)
- Set up GitHub Pages (havocked.github.io/curator/)
- Removed stale custom domain (natanielmartin.com) from havocked.github.io CNAME

## Real-World Test: Berlin Friday Night
Scraped Berghain + Tresor lineups for Friday Feb 13, ran through curator.

### Bugs Found
1. **Artist disambiguation failures:**
   - "Nastia" (techno DJ) → resolved to "Потап и Настя" (Ukrainian pop duo)
   - "The Advent" (techno duo) → resolved to "Advents" (metalcore band)
   
2. **Feature bleed / primary artist filtering:**
   - IsoXo's top tracks include Skrillex collab → Skrillex appears in results
   - Job Jobse's tracks include Kölsch, Joje features
   - Interplanetary Criminal pulls Eliza Rose, Sammy Virji
   - **Fix needed:** Filter to tracks where queried artist is PRIMARY credit, not just featured

## Real-World Test 2: Powerline Berlin Poster
Nate photographed a concert poster on the street — 14 artists, ran through curator.

### Results
- 10/14 artists matched correctly
- Genre enrichment: 32/39 tracks got accurate genres (82%)
- BPM: 0/39 — Tidal returned null for every track (indie/electronic lineup)
- **Dry Cleaning** — search failed entirely despite being on Tidal
- **Nalan** → resolved to Nala Sinephro (wrong artist)
- **Burnout Ostwest** → resolved to Burnout Syndromes (Japanese anime rock, lol)
- **Marlon Magnée** → got La Femme tracks (his band) + Sam Quealy (feature bleed)

### Key Insights
- Feature bleed is the #1 usability issue
- Fuzzy artist matching too loose ("Nalan" ≠ "Nala Sinephro")
- Tidal BPM coverage genuinely terrible on indie/electronic
- Genre enrichment is the star feature — accurate every time

## IDEAS.md Created
Nate brain-dumped ~15 project ideas at 1:23am. All captured in ~/clawd/IDEAS.md.
Categories: health/medical, music/events, career, travel/vacation planning, food ordering, marketplace, privacy infra.
Common thread: CLI-first, close the loop, composable.

## State
- Master: clean, 108 tests, all passing
- Repo: public (havocked/curator)
- GitHub Pages live (havocked.github.io/curator/)
- No BPM provider (deferred — may try MusicBrainz recordings or alternative later)
- IDEAS.md exists at workspace root for future project planning
